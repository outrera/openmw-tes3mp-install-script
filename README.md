# OpenMW+TES3MP installer/launcher
Script that takes care of installing and launching various versions of OpenMW and TES3MP.

:warning:Possibly the worst example of sphagetti code that world has ever seen.:warning:

Script is not yet stable and / or ready for release. Use at your own risk.
(It's not like I put some `rm -rf /` in there. but still, keep in mind that it's a prototype)
